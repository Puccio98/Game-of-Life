# Conway's Game-of-Life
Conway’s Game of Life - HCI 2021-2022 Programming Assignment

## Overview
The Game of Life was invented in 1970 by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. He developed an interest in a problem which was made evident in the 1940’s by mathematician John von Neumann, who aimed to find a hypothetical machine that had the ability to create copies of itself and was successful when he discovered a mathematical model for such a machine with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid. Thus, the Game of Life was Conway’s way of simplifying von Neumann’s ideas. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton which is any system in which rules are applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid. Martin Gardner popularized the Game of Life by writing two articles for his column “Mathematical Games” in the journal Scientific American in 1970 and 1971.

## Rules of the Game
The game is played on a two-dimensional grid (or board). Each grid location is either empty or populated by a single cell. A location’s **neighbors** are any cells in the surrounding **eight adjacent locations**. The simulation of starts from an **initial state** of populated locations and then **progresses through time**. The evolution of the board state is governed by a few simple rules:
1. Each populated location with one or zero neighbors dies (from loneliness).
2. Each populated location with four or more neighbors dies (from overpopulation).
3. Each populated location with two or three neighbors survives.
4. Each unpopulated location that becomes populated if it has exactly **three** populated neighbors.
5. All updates are performed simultaneously **in parallel**.

This figure illustrates the rules for cell death, survival, and birth:

## Implementation
The implementation is done in Python, making use of the MVC architectural pattern together with Observer.
PyQt5 is used for the GUI realization whilst Numpy and Scipy are used to perform the update computations on the game board.

#### The Model
The Model is implemented in the `CheckboardModel` class: there we hold the state of the game, the methods to manage the state, the logic to update the View, the color personalization methods and the load/save functionalities. In order to keep this class not too complex two other classes were employed: `Cell` and `GameColors`.

The current state is represented as a dictionary where the keys are tuples `(i,j)` and the values are `Cell`: if the key `(i,j)` exists then such position is occupied by a `Cell` of a certain state (either `"Alive"`, `"Dead"` or `"Born"`).  
In order to track the status of the game through time we make use of a list named `boardHistory`, which holds all the state dictionaries that were built, so that we're able to navigate the steps the game has gone through.   

The **game loop** is managed as well in the `CheckboardModel` class: through the use of a `QTimer` we periodically call the `.next()` method, which computes the next board based on the current state, then notifies the View. We can interact with the timer through the dedicated methods to set the speed.

#### The GUI
The class `App` is in charge to create both the Model and the GUI. The GUI consists of **4 components**:
1) `Toolbar`: contains load/save/help functions (on top).
2) `ConfigPanel`: interface to manage the cell size and interface colors. 
3) `GameGrid`: it's the grid where the Game of Life is displayed (it's the View in our MVC).
4) `SimulationPanel`: contains the controllers for the game: play/pause/back/next/speed/reset.

Each component is coupled to the Model and uses it to gather everything that needs to presented to the user. The updates of the Model are notified to these components through Observer design pattern.

## Application Features
The main window looks like this:

##### Interact with the State
The user can interact with the current state drawing new cells using a **left click** whilst with a **right click** he can remove the selected cell. We have this same effect when dragging the mouse while clicking.

##### Start/Pause/Reset
The game simulation starts clicking the play button and can be paused with the pause button on the left. We can reset the state with the specific button on the right.

##### Variable Framerate
Through the speed slider we're able to change the speed of the simulation, from a minimum of `2 fps` up tp `30 fps`. The default value is `10 fps`.  

##### Save/Load Game
It is possible to save the current game to a `.gol` file through the specific option in the `File` menù on top. The created file is a raw-binary file generated by `pickle` package, writing to file the `boardHistory` attribute of the Model. Such games can then be loaded with the specific load option, which reads the pickle file and loads it to the `boardHistory`.

##### Navigate Game History
Through the arrows down on the left it is possible to navigate the previous states of the board as shown below:

##### Custom Colors
It is possible to customize the colors of the 3 types of cells. This can help to visualize how the board state is evolving, as shown below:

##### Responsive Layout
The layout is responsive to window resize:
